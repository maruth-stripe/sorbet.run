## ‚û°Ô∏è  Let‚Äôs build a type checker.

- <span style="opacity: 0.3;">**Do nothing**: Opportunity cost (productivity, breakages)</span>

- <span style="opacity: 0.3;">**Rewrite everything**: 100s of engineers, all-or-nothing</span>

- <span style="opacity: 0.3;">**Rewrite some things**: 10s(?) of engineers, partial impact</span>

- **Type checker**: 3 engineers, incremental value in months

## Sorbet: A type checker for Ruby

- Goal: check types **statically** (not only at runtime)

- Goal: support **existing** Ruby code (not a new language)

- Goal: type check **quickly** (vs running tests)

## üôå How we designed Sorbet

<span>1. Explicit</span>

<span style="opacity: 0.3">2. Useful, not burdensome</span>

<span style="opacity: 0.3">3. As simple as possible, but powerful enough</span>

<span style="opacity: 0.3">4. Compatible with Ruby</span>

<span style="opacity: 0.3">5. Scalable on all axes</span>

<span>6. Gradual</span>

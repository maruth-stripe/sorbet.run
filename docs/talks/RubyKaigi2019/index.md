### Sorbet at Stripe Breakdown

- <span style="visibility: hidden;">**8 months** building from scratch (Oct 2017 ‚Äì May 2018)</span>
- **7 months** rolling out (Jun 2018 ‚Äì Dec 2018)
- <span style="visibility: hidden;">**4+ months** on editor and OSS tooling (Jan 2019 ‚Äì ¬∑¬∑¬∑)</span>

Note:

When adopting Sorbet at Stripe, we focused on identifying errors, and then
catching those errors in as many places as possible.

Let's look at three (of them many) kinds of errors we caught.

---

### Uninitialized constant errors

```ruby

class Hello

end

def main
  puts Helo.new
end

main
```

```console



‚ùØ
```

---

### Uninitialized constant errors

```ruby

class Hello

end

def main
  puts Helo.new
end

main
```

```console
‚ùØ ruby hello.rb
hello.rb:7:in `main': uninitialized constant Helo (NameError)
Did you mean?  Hello
        from hello.rb:12:in `<main>'
```

---

### Uninitialized constant errors

```ruby
# typed: false
class Hello

end

def main
  puts Helo.new
end

main
```

```console
‚ùØ ruby hello.rb
hello.rb:7:in `main': uninitialized constant Helo (NameError)
Did you mean?  Hello
        from hello.rb:12:in `<main>'
```

---

### Uninitialized constant errors

```ruby
# typed: false
class Hello

end

def main
  puts Helo.new
end

main
```

```console
‚ùØ srb
hello.rb:7: Unable to resolve constant `Helo`
     7 |  puts Helo.new
               ^^^^
```

---

### üéâ 100% of Ruby files at Stripe!

```ruby
# typed: false
class Hello

end

def main
  puts Helo.new
end

main
```

```console
‚ùØ srb
hello.rb:7: Unable to resolve constant `Helo`
     7 |  puts Helo.new
               ^^^^
```

---

### Undefined method errors

```ruby
# typed: false
class Hello
  def greeting; 'Hello, world!'; end
end

def main
  puts Hello.new.greet
end

main
```

```console



‚ùØ
```

---

### Undefined method errors

```ruby
# typed: false
class Hello
  def greeting; 'Hello, world!'; end
end

def main
  puts Hello.new.greet
end

main
```

```console
‚ùØ ruby hello.rb
hello.rb:7:in `main': undefined method `greet'
Did you mean?  greeting
        from hello.rb:10:in `<main>'
```

---

### Undefined method errors

```ruby
# typed: true
class Hello
  def greeting; 'Hello, world!'; end
end

def main
  puts Hello.new.greet
end

main
```

```console
‚ùØ ruby hello.rb
hello.rb:7:in `main': undefined method `greet'
Did you mean?  greeting
        from hello.rb:10:in `<main>'
```

---

### Undefined method errors

```ruby
# typed: true
class Hello
  def greeting; 'Hello, world!'; end
end

def main
  puts Hello.new.greet
end

main
```

```console
‚ùØ srb
hello.rb:7: Method greet does not exist on `Hello`
     7 |  puts Hello.new.greet
               ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
```

---

### üéâ 80% of Ruby files at Stripe!

```ruby
# typed: true
class Hello
  def greeting; 'Hello, world!'; end
end

def main
  puts Hello.new.greet
end

main
```

```console
‚ùØ srb
hello.rb:7: Method greet does not exist on `Hello`
     7 |  puts Hello.new.greet
               ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
```

---

### Even more errors

- What types does this method take?
- Could this thing be nil?

---

### &nbsp;

```ruby

def do_thing(x)
  # ...
end

do_thing('')  # is this ok?
do_thing(nil) # is this ok?
```

---

### &nbsp;

```ruby
sig {params(x: String).void}
def do_thing(x)
  # ...
end

do_thing('')  # is this ok?
do_thing(nil) # is this ok?
```

---

### &nbsp;

```ruby
sig {params(x: String).void}
def do_thing(x)
  # ...
end

do_thing('')  # this is ok!
do_thing(nil) # this is not ok!
```

---

### üéâ 62% of methods at Stripe have a signature!

```ruby
sig {params(x: String).void}
def do_thing(x)
  # ...
end

do_thing('')  # this is ok!
do_thing(nil) # this is not ok!
```

---

### ‚è™ Recap: What we achieved

- **100%** of files: `# typed: false`
  - Catch uninitialized constants!
- **81%** of files: `# typed: true`
  - Catch `NoMethodError`s!
- **62%** of methods have signatures
  - Catch no type errors!

Note:

- Proud of our progress, versus our peers, and how early stage we are
- We like to think our progress is because of how well designed Sorbet is

---

## What our users say

---

### A tool for understanding

![](img/once-every-never.png)

---

### An interactive experience

![](img/billing-loves-sorbet.png)

---

### Editor tooling

![](img/pay-money.png)

Note:

Somewhere along the way we built a very rough IDE prototype.
People loved it.

---

## What we learned

- Sorbet is powerful enough to fit many needs
- Stripe engineers want editor tooling!
- Adding types to a codebase takes time
  - ... but automated tooling can make it take less time

Note:

At first, we would have been ok with taking 20 minutes.
Now, we're getting asked for *sub-second* response times.

### VSCode

Note:
- Don't say LSP

(IDE features only work on desktop)

---

### Code Browsing (by Sourcegraph)

![](img/sourcegraph.gif)

Note:

- What website is this?
- It is github!
- Beauty of our backend is it is generic
- Our friends over at Sourcegraph already have LSP support
- We gave them access to the Sorbet sourcecode and they took our webasm pipeline
  and exposed our `--lsp` mode and magically it worked!

## üéâ Ruby 3 & Types!

- Ruby 3 stdlib will ship with type definitions
- We're collaborating closely with the Ruby core team
- See talks by **@matz**, **@soutaro**, and **@mame**

---

## üéâ Open source soon!

- Already in Private Beta
  - 3 other core companies contributed code
  - 5 testing it as users
- Want in?
  - <sorbet@stripe.com>
  - Describe your setup (LOC? number of contributors?)

Note:
- Coinbase
- Shopify
- SourceGraph

---

## Why not open source yet?

- Philosophy: Make experience great
  - Slowly expand private beta
  - Mix of small, medium, and large codebases
  - Once the experience is good for a batch, ship it
- Date: Summer 2019
- https://stripe.com/blog

Note:
If the conference organizers had done it the same time as last year we might
have something else to announce :)

---

## üéâ https://sorbet.org

We are releasing the docs today!

---

## üéâ Open source tooling

Sneak peak:

```ruby
# Gemfile
gem 'sorbet', :group => :development
gem 'sorbet-runtime'
```

```bash
‚ùØ srb init
...
```

```bash
‚ùØ srb
No errors! Great job
```

Note:
- We are deploying using standard Ruby tooling

## Intialize

```bash
‚ùØ srb init
üëã Hey there!
This script will get this project ready to use with Sorbet by
creating a `sorbet/` folder for your project. It will contain:

...

‚úÖ Done!
This project is now set up for use with Sorbet.
```

---

## Typechecking

```bash
‚ùØ srb
No errors! Great job.
```

---

## An Initialized Project

```bash
sorbet/
‚îÇ # Default options to passed to sorbet on every run
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ config
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ rbi/
    ‚îÇ # Community-written type definition files for your gems
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ sorbet-typed/
    ‚îÇ # Autogenerated type definitions for your gems
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ gems/
    ‚îÇ # Things defined when run, but hidden statically
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ hidden-definitions/
    ‚îÇ # Constants which were still missing
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ todo.rbi
```

---

## `sorbet-typed` (by Coinbase)

https://github.com/sorbet/sorbet-typed/

> A central repository for sharing type defintions for Ruby gems

---

## DSL Extension (by Shopify)

```ruby
attribute my_id, :integer
```

becomes

```ruby
sig {returns(T.nilable(Integer))}
def my_id; end

sig {returns(T::Boolean)}
def my_id?; end

sig {params(new_value: T.nilable(Integer)).void}
def my_id=(new_value); end
```

Note:
- You can teach sorbet about your DSL

---

## Implementation

```ruby
attribute my_id, :integer
```

```bash
‚ùØ srb tc --dsl-plugins plugins.yaml
```

```yaml
# plugins.yaml
attribute: my_id.rb
```

```ruby
# my_id.rb
prop, type = ARGV[5].gsub("attribute ", "").delete(":").split(",")

puts "sig {returns(T.nilable(#{type.upcase}))}"
puts "def #{prop}; end"
...
```

```ruby
sig {returns(T.nilable(Integer))}
def my_id; end
...
```

---

## Typechecking Rails

```
‚ùØ rails new blog
```

<div style="height:400px">
![](img/rails_new.png)
</div>

---

## It typechecks!

```bash
‚ùØ git grep -h typed: | sort | uniq -c
    2 # typed: false
  120 # typed: true
```

---

## Typechecking Rails

- Only needed 7 hand-written type signatures
- 1 new feature
- Most other signatures are autogenerated by reflection

---

## Closing

- Editors under active development
- Open sourcing very soon!
  - Already in private beta with 8 folks
- Works with Rails
- Check out [sorbet.org](https://sorbet.org)

# Thank you!

Brace yourselves, Sorbet is coming

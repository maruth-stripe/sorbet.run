- Have questions? Reach us at <a href="mailto:sorbet@stripe.com">sorbet@stripe.com</a>

Note:

- Yes, we very much would like to open source this. 
- today gather feedback and find folks who are interested in collaborating. 
- I hate throwing code over the wall. Instead we want to release when we can
dedicate the time to helping the community use it.
- But wait, this isn't just a vaporware announcement :) We have a browser demo.

Now open: https://sorbet.run/#%221%22%20%2B%202

Note:

And with that brief teaser, let me hand off to Dmitry to dive into our type
system.

---

## Type System Design Principles

- Explicit
- Feel useful, not burdensome
- As simple as possible, but powerful enough
- Compatible with Ruby
- Scales
- Can be adopted gradually

Note:

- Explicit

  We're willing to write annotations, and in fact see them as
  beneficial; They make code more readable and predictable. We're here
  to help readers as much as writers.

- Feel useful, not burdensome

  While it is explicit, we are putting effort into making it concise.
  This shows in multiple ways:
   - error messages should be clear
   - verbosity should be compensated with more safety

- As simple as possible, but powerful enough

  Overall, we are not strong believers in super-complex type
  systems. They have their place, and we need a fair amount of
  expressive power to model (enough) real Ruby code, but all else
  being equal we want to be simpler. We believe that such a system
  scales better, and -- most importantly -- is easiest for users to
  learn+understand.

- Compatible with Ruby

  In particular, we don't want new syntax. Existing Ruby syntax means
  we can leverage most of our existing tooling (editors, etc). Also,
  the whole point here is to improve an existing Ruby codebase, so we
  should be able to adopt it incrementally.


- Scales

  On all axes: in speed, team size, codebase size and time (not
  postponing hard decisions). We're already a large codebase, and will
  only get larger.

- Can be adopted gradually

    In order to make adoption possible at scale, we cannot require all
    the teams to adopt it at once, thus we need to support teams adopting it
    at different pace.

# Demo (usage)

Note:
  One of the most areas where those principles can be seen is error messages.
  The following slides show several examples of them.

---

## Usage: Calls into stdlib

```ruby
# Integer
([1, 2].count + 3).next
```

<br/>

<div class="fragment">
```ruby
"str" + :sym
```

```console
Expression passed as an argument `arg0` to method `+`
      does not match expected type
      github.com/stripe/sorbet/wiki/7002
     1 |"str" + :sym
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^
    github.com/stripe/sorbet/tree/master/rbi/core/string.rbi#L18:
    Method `+` has specified type of argument `arg0` as `String`
    18 |      arg0: String,
              ^^^^^
  Got Symbol(:"sym") originating from:
    -e:1:
     1 |"str" + :sym
                ^^^^
```

<div/>
---

## Usage: truthiness

```ruby
foo = array_of_strings[0]
# foo is a T.nilable(String) now
return true if foo.nil?
# foo is a String now
return foo.empty?
```

<br/>
<div class="fragment">

```ruby
foo = array_of_strings[0]
return foo.empty?
```

```console
Method `empty?` does not exist on `NilClass`
component of `T.nilable(String)`
     5 |return foo.empty?
               ^^^^^^^^^^
```

<div/>

---

## Usage: dead code

```ruby
if Random.rand > 0.5
    foo = 1
else
    foo = 2
end
# foo is an Integer
```

<br/>

<div class="fragment">

```ruby
if Random.rand
    foo = 1
else
    foo = 2
end
```

```console
This code is unreachable
     6 |    foo = 2
                  ^
```

<div/>
Note:

  - We see that foo is assinged on both cases in first example
  - second example has a bug that could have been made by a C person.


---

## Usage: union types

```ruby
str_or_int = ["1", 2].sample
hash = str_or_int.succ
```

<br/>

<div class="fragment">

```ruby
str_or_int_or_array = ["1", 2, [3]].sample
hash = str_or_int_or_array.succ
```

```console
Method `succ` does not exist on `Array` component of
`T.any(String, Integer, T::Array[Integer])`
     4 |hash = str_or_int_or_array.succ
                                  ^^^^^
```

<div/>

---

# Declaration Syntax

---

## Declaration: Compatible syntax

```ruby
extend T::Helpers
...
sig(
    # Both positional and named parameters are referred to by name.
    # You must declare all parameters (and the return value below).
    amount: Integer,
    currency: String,
)
.returns(Stripe::Charge)
def create_charge(amount, currency)
    ...
end
```

Note:
 here you can see the syntax used to declare types of arguments of the method.
 This syntax is a ruby dsl. As you can see (~read the slide)

---

## Declaration: Runtime Typesystem

```ruby
sig(amount: Integer, currency: String)
.returns(Stripe::Charge)
def create_charge(amount, currency)
    ...
end

create_charge(10_000, :jpy)
```

```console
#<TypeError: Parameter currency:
  Expected type String, got type Symbol>
```

Note:
  Even before we've started building a static typechecker,
  we have built a dynamic one.
  This dynamic one uses data provided via same dsl
  to perform runtime type checks in production.
  If they fail, it raises an error that will include a complete
  stacktrace as well as data that violated the type constraint.


---

## Declaration: Local Inference

```ruby
sig.returns(String) # Optional but not inferred
def foo
    a = 5 # Integer
    a = T.let("str", String) # String
end
```

Note:
 some people think that typesystems can be too verbose.
 We agree. This is why we want our to be concise.
 In particular here you don't need to specify type of variable a,
 we can infer that it is integer.

 If you do want to declare a type of variable, we you can do so with T.let.
 In this example, you re-assign a to a string and you explicitly daclare
 that you wanted a to become a string.

---

## Declaration: strictness level

```ruby
#
# Basic checks such as syntax errors are enabled by default
```

<div class="fragment">
  
```ruby
# typed: true
# Enables type checking
```

<div/>

<div class="fragment">
  
```ruby
# typed: strict
# Additionally requires ivars to be declared
```

<div/>

<div class="fragment">
  
```ruby
# typed: strong
# The safest level: disallows calling untyped code
```
  
<div/>

---
## Declaration: Generic classes


```ruby
class Box
  extend T::Generic

  Elem = type_member

  sig.returns(Elem)
  attr_reader :x

  sig(x: Elem).returns(Elem)
  attr_writer :x
end

int_box = Box[Integer].new
```

Note:

 Our typesystem also has minimal number of features to model Ruby code.
 One of such features is generics.
 In this example, we model a box that can store an element of a specific type.
 Box declaration does not know what it will store.
 I will be specified by use site.

 The most common use of this is to model various containers: arrays, sets, hashes

---
## Declaration: Generic methods

```ruby
class Array
  Elem = type_member

  type_parameters(:U).sig(
      blk: T.proc(arg0: Elem).returns(T.type_parameter(:U)),
  )
  .returns(T::Array[T.type_parameter(:U)])
  def map(&blk); end
end
```

Note:

  We can also model methods with complex signatures such as Array map
  that require generic methods. They are somewhat verbose,
  but they are very descriptive and express the usecase well.

# Practical experience

Note:

Throwback to the title of our talk -- "a practical typechecker for
Ruby" -- and I want to link this to our experience at Stripe

---

## Internal rollout

- Working on this since last year
- Runtime types have been deployed for 6 months
- Static checker in internal beta
 - engineers can opt in
- Command-line tool

---

## Early adoption

- Human-authored signatures: 3k
- Files annotated by users: 150+
- Generated signatures: 240k

---

# Some bugs we found

Note:

These are some bugs we found in the process of rolling out the
typechecker, that slipped through CI and code review. Fortunately our
test coverage and processes are pretty good so none of these were
critical, but they are pretty informative of the experience of using
the tool and the kinds of issues we can catch.

- Examples are simplified but based on real code.

---

## Typos in error handling

```ruby
    begin
      data = JSON.parse(File.read(path))
    rescue JSON::ParseError => e
      raise "#{PACKAGE_REL_PATH} contains invalid JSON: #{e}"
    end
```

```console
json.rb:6: Unable to resolve constant ParseError
    6 |  rescue JSON::ParseError => e
                ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
   shims/gems/json.rbi:319: Did you mean: ::JSON::ParserError?
    319 |class JSON::ParserError < JSON::JSONError
         ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
```

---

## Errors in error handling

```ruby
   if look_ahead_days < 1 || look_ahead_days > 30
     raise ArgumentError('look_ahead_days must be between […]')
   end
```

```console
argumenterror.rb:9: Method ArgumentError does not exist on […]
```

Note:

Here we see another error inside an error-handling block. Someone
tried to call the function `ArgumentError`, instead of calling its
constructor -- perhaps they have been writing too much Python.

Here again we see that sorbert has identified the error and reported
that that method does not exist.

---

## `nil` checks

```ruby
app.post '/v1/webhook/:id/update' do
  endpoint = WebhookEndpoint.load(params[:id])
  update_webhook(endpoint, params)
end
```

```console
webhook.rb:16: Expression passed as an argument `endpoint`
    to method `update_webhook` does not match expected type
  16 |    update_webhook(webhook, params)
          ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

webhook.rb:10: Method update_webhook has specified type
    of argument endpoint as WebhookEndpoint
  Got T.nilable(WebhookEndpoint)
```

Note:

- strict nilability found a bug in an endpoint that handled an API
  request.
- This endpoint takes a Webhook ID from a user and updates it in our
  system
- the typechecker knows that `load` returns a webhook object or `nil`
  if that ID doesn't exist, and that `update_webhook` needs a
  non-`nil` webhook objecrt
- We detect the missing check

---

## `nil` checks (fixed)

```ruby
app.post '/v1/webhook/:id/update' do
  endpoint = WebhookEndpoint.load(params[:id])
  if endpoint.nil?
    raise UserError.new(:webhook_endpoint_not_found)
  end
  update_webhook(endpoint, params)
end
```

Note:

- Easy to fix; If we add the natural check you should have written
  anyways, we recognize the pattern and quiet the error

---

## Instance variables from `self.`
```ruby
# typed: strict
class ChargeCreator
  def initialize
    @request = …
  end

  def self.log_results
    log.info("charge created request_id=#{@request&.trace_id}")
  end
end
```

```console
charge.rb:9: Use of undeclared variable @request
     9 |    log.info("charge created request_id=#{@request&.trace_id}")
                                                  ^^^^^^^^
```

Note:

Files can opt-in to require declaring instance and class
variables. Here we found a bug in existing code where an instance
variable was set and then attempted to be accessed from the wrong
scope.

---
## Incorrect pattern matching

```ruby
  case transaction
      ...
      when Stripe::Charge || Stripe::Refund
      ...
  end
```


```console
case.rb:12: This code is unreachable
    12 |when Stripe::Refund || Stripe::Charge
                               ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
```

Note:

Do a careful walk through

## Open source

- Sneak peak: <a href="https://sorbet.run">https://sorbet.run</a>
- Will open source, timeline TBD
- When released we will support it
- Will post on stripe.com/blog
- <a href="mailto:sorbet@stripe.com">sorbet@stripe.com</a>

Note:

- Try out the browser demo. 
- core typechecker is done, most of the work for us is around how to roll it out to a big codebase. 
- How do you deal with metaprogramming, or unannotated gems, or editor integrations. 
- Please play with it and give us feedback.

---

## Using it

- Interested in your use cases
- Large orgs scaling with Ruby
- Will let you know when it's ready for beta
- <a href="mailto:sorbet@stripe.com">sorbet@stripe.com</a>

Note:

- Interested in your use cases
- Two classes particularly interested in
- Our dev productivity team existed for 2.5 years now and we've focussed largely on how to scale our Ruby for the needs of
Stripe, so we have some tools to share. 
- We've put a lot of effort into this space. 
- Having said that, we also really want to use your tools and systems too!

---

## Building it

- There are multiple parties working to add types to Ruby
- We'd love to chat and share
- <a href="mailto:sorbet@stripe.com">sorbet@stripe.com</a>

Note:

- if you are working on typechecking Ruby or scaling Ruby we would love to chat. 
- Please email us or find us somehow. 

---
